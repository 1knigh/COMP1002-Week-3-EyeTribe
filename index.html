          <h2>How it works</h2>
             <p>The Eye Tribe uses a device called the Eye Tracker or gaze tracker. This device calculates the gaze point of a user as they look around. The device can be combined with other input devices like the mouse, keyboard, touch etc. The users eyes are tracked by the sensor which is place below the screen of the device. The eye gaze coordinates are calculated with respect to a screen the user is looking at. The system works for a variety of different users thanks to the calibration system. Before the user games with the device they must complete a colibration process. Everyone has different eyes and the eye tracker device can store many different users eye characteristics. </p>

             <h2>Make Way For The Future</h2>
             <p>The Eye Tribe software does stop at satisfying the user. It collects data when the user is not gaming or using the device. The product uses the data and it is sent to the development team to fix or improve the device.
             The Eye Tribe's software is not made private for the corporations benefits. The code for the program is made public for all those who are fascinated by the creation of a different breed of gaming.</p>
